# External Software Dependencies

These software packages are integral to the cloud workstation and batch scaling functionality.  The original list is on the [NMFS PAM-Cloud website](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Cloud/content/Cloud.Processing.html).  

We prioritized this [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s0lUsCWJm9VMdhhWE3o-rhpLRqE_raIRrxOO14fTrAk/edit?usp=share_link).  There is an issue with steps to further refine the list before copying the final results in this file.

TODO: Copy the issue number into this file.
